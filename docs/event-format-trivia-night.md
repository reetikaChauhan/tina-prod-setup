## Primary goal - have fun and learn

- People love trivia. There's extra spirit that comes with the team competition.

- By forming teams with people who don't know each other, a shared bond emerges when trying to solve questions together.

## There are 6 steps

:::note The 6 Steps

1. Find a partner

2. Pick a venue

3. Prepare questions

4. Promote the event

5. Put on a show

6. Share the results
:::

## STEP ONE: Find a partner

It's a lot easier with a partner. 

- You can help each other come up with questions

- One person does emcee duties

- The other person collects answers from the tables and tallies the score


## STEP TWO: Pick a Venue

Make a list of potential venues.

Consider
- **Size** (not to small)

- **Location** (easy to get to)

- **Amenities** (food and drinks on site, seating, not too noisy)

:::tip
As your list of venues grow, **Share It** for future reference with other organizers.
:::


### Special Considerations

- Prizes

- Audio amplification

- Food and drink service

- Seating for the audience


The best way to pay for prizes is to **find a sponsor**.

### How to find a sponsor

- Make a list of climate tech companies in your area. Go to [climatetechlist.com](https://climatetechlist.com) or [climatebase.org](https://climatebase.org) and filter by location.

- Find connections on LinkedIn, ask for intros to get in the door. You can try messaging someone who works there on the [Work on Climate Slack Community](https://workonclimate.org).

- Make your pitch in the company's interest by giving thanking them and allowing them to announce something before the panel starts.
If a venue requires a reservation fee, you may have luck requesting a waiver in support of the climate change community.


:::info Nuture your sponsors
It's great to have a reliable sponsor for future events.

If you nurture the relationship, other community organizers who need sponsors can benefit.

This is a fantastic way to grow your local ecosystem
:::

### Prize ideas

- Gift cards

- Organic apple cider and chocolates


### Audio amplification

Find a bar that has hosted previous events with audio. For example:

- A trivia night (call and ask if they are open to a climate theme)

- Karaoke

- Stand up comedy

## STEP THREE: Prepare questions

### Question ideas and formats

- **Balance difficulty** - not too easy and not too difficult

- **Topics** - you can pick a central theme or try to mix it up. Some examples:

  - [Climate Solutions](solutions) - e.g. Built Environment, Transportation, Agriculture
  - Emission guess - e.g. "what has more emissions, cement or jet fuel?"
  - Policies - name the legislation that opened up new funding and tax credits 

- **Formats** - Use slides and multimedia. For example:

  - Images: display a picture of a cute exotic animal and try to name them
  - Sound: pay 30 seconds of a song related to nature and guess the name 
  - Alphabet soup: solve the acronym (IPCC, CHIP, COP, IRA, BIL)



## STEP FOUR: Create a Sharable Event
Use a tool such as [Luma](https://lu.ma) to craft a sharable event. Ensure the climate theme and any other goals or activities are clear.

Utilize various marketing channels such as social media platforms, email newsletters, and your personal network to spread the word. Encourage others to share the event.

:::tip
In Seattle - we use the [Work on Climate Slack](workonclimate.org) and post in the #meet-seattle channel  
:::

## STEP FIVE: Show Up
1. Beforehand, gather any required materials. Common materials are markers and name tags.

2. Arrive early on the event day to set up, address any last-minute concerns, and be ready to welcome attendees with organization and enthusiasm.


:::info Remember
Take a big group photo!

## STEP SIX: Share the Results!
After the event, utilize social media to share the highlights with those who attended and those who missed out. Sharing the results not only celebrates the success of the event but also encourages future engagement and participation.
