# Bioplastics

## Technology Overview

Bioplastics are a type of plastic derived from renewable biomass sources such as vegetable fats and oils, plant-based cellulose or starches, or some combination of the above. They are often touted as a more sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics, as they can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

## Commentary

"Despite the potential benefits, bioplastics remain unpopular, expensive, and difficult to scale." 
(Alex Blum, Co-founder/CEO at Applied Bioplastics) [^AB]
