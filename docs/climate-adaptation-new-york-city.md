*Climate Adaptation and Resilience ([New York Tech](https://www.nyit.edu/news/features/2022_energy_conference_climate_adaptation_and_resilience))*

## Overview

New York, located along the Atlantic coast, has historically suffered from numerous hurricanes. Additionally, the city faces climate risks such as sea-level rise, floods, and heatwaves. In New York's 2007 plans, attention was drawn to the impact of climate change on the city. The New York plan revised in 2011 placed even more emphasis on urban resilience to climate change, addressing the changes that have already occurred. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit New York, resulting in 43 deaths and significant damage to the city, prompting the release of the [New York Adaptation Plan](https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/) in 2013. This plan aimed to build a stronger and more resilient New York.

## Progress Made

* New York has invested significantly in infrastructure upgrades, such as the $20 billion plan for flood defenses, improved power infrastructure, and reinforcing buildings and public housing against extreme weather events.
* New York updated its building codes to withstand future climate risks better. The [updated codes](https://www.nyc.gov/site/buildings/codes/2022-construction-codes.page) encourage new buildings to incorporate climate resilience into their designs.
* New York launched initiatives like the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project, aiming to strengthen the coastal areas of Manhattan against sea-level rise and storm surges.
* New York has worked to implement green infrastructure solutions, like permeable surfaces and bioswales, to improve stormwater management and reduce flood risks.

## Lessons Learned

* Climate adaptation is a complex issue that touches on various sectors of society. The New York Adaptation Plan showed that collaboration across sectors (public, private, non-profit, etc.) and disciplines is crucial for successful planning and implementation.
* The adaptation plan demonstrated that community involvement is critical for success. Local communities should be involved in the planning and implementation process to ensure that the adaptation measures meet their needs.
* The plan requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation of adaptation measures.

## Challenges Ahead

* Secure sufficient and consistent funds for the plan's implementation and maintenance.
* Adapt or replace old infrastructure not designed with climate change in mind.
* Remain flexible in planning to account for a range of possible climate scenarios.
* Improve public understanding of climate change risks and the necessity of adaptation measures.

## Best Path Forward

* Enhanced collaboration across public, private, and nonprofit sectors, along with academia
* Make sure that social equity issues are taken into account in the development of adaptation strategies
* With [rising sea levels](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/23/world/nyc-sinking-sea-level-climate-scn/index.html) being a major concern for the city, the focus should remain on enhancing coastal defenses to guard against storm surges and flooding.
* Seek out and secure long-term, sustainable sources of funding for climate adaptation measures.
* Incorporate climate adaptation goals and strategies into all relevant city policies and planning work.
