Hey folks ðŸ‘‹  thanks for stopping by!

I started The Climate Tech Handbook because I knew two things:

1. I wanted to spend every second I could working on the climate emergency
2. I wanted to see if it's actually possible to make a decent living doing it

**What I found was astonishing.**

There number of [resources](../resources) out there are ASTRONOMICAL.

Impossible for a single brain to handle.

The other problem is that it's really hard to find an employer who is the perfect match.

Even if you do, **it's really hard to stand out** from 500 other resumes without understanding the biggest challenges in their industry.

So here we are, an early version 0.9 edition of The Climate Tech Handbook.
